                             <p>    (a) Force Majeure. Billeroo shall not be liable or responsible to you, nor be deemed to have defaulted or breached this Agreement, for any failure or delay in fulfilling or performing any term of this Agreement when and to the extent such failure or delay is caused by or results from acts or circumstances beyond the reasonable control of Billeroo including, but not limited to, acts of God, flood, fire, earthquake, explosion, governmental actions, war, invasion or hostilities (whether war is declared or not), terrorist threats or acts, riot, or other civil unrest, national emergency, revolution, insurrection, epidemic, lock-outs, strikes or other labor disputes (whether or not relating to either party's workforce), or restraints or delays affecting carriers or inability or delay in obtaining supplies of adequate or suitable materials, materials or telecommunication breakdown or power outage, provided that, if the event in question continues for a continuous period in excess of ten (10) days, you shall be entitled to give notice in writing to Billeroo to terminate this Agreement.<br>
                            (b) Entire Agreement. This Agreement, any Additional Terms, any separate but relevant Pricing Agreements, and our Privacy Policy constitute the entire agreement between you and us with respect to your use of the Services, and supersede all previous written or oral agreements between the parties with respect to such subject matter.<br>
                            (c) Governing Law and Jurisdiction. All matters relating to our website, the Services, this Agreement and any dispute or claim arising therefrom or related thereto (in each case, including non-contractual disputes or claims), shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the country of registration of the AltPayNet entity which you, the user or merchant, entered and signed a Billeroo agreement with without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the country of registration of the AltPayNet entity you entered and signed a Billeroo agreement with or any other jurisdiction). Any legal suit, action or proceeding arising out of, or related to our website, the Services, and/or this Agreement shall be instituted exclusively in respective courts of the country of origin of the relevant AltPayNet entity . You waive any and all objections to the exercise of jurisdiction over you by such courts and to venue in such courts.<br>
                            (d) Waiver and Severability. No waiver of any breach or default hereunder shall be deemed to be a waiver of any preceding or subsequent breach or default. If any provision of this Agreement is held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be eliminated or limited to the minimum extent such that the remaining provisions of the Agreement will continue in full force and effect.<br>
                            (e) Assignment. You may not transfer or assign any rights or obligations you have under this Agreement without Billeroo's prior written consent. Billeroo reserves the right to transfer or assign this Agreement or any right or obligation under them at any time.<br>
